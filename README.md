# üìö DSA-Solutions ‚Äì My Data Structures & Algorithms Journey in Java

This repository is a personal collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms** problems solved in **Java**.  
It is organized **folder-wise** according to topics, each containing clean and optimized solutions following common DSA patterns.

## üìÇ Folder Structure & Problem Index

#### 1. Two Sum (LeetCode 1)
**Problem:**  
Finds two numbers in an array that sum to a given target using a hash map for **O(n)** complexity.  

**File:** `Array&String/Twosum.java`

---

#### 2. Concatenation of Array (LeetCode 1929)
**Problem:**  
Concatenates an array to itself and returns the new array.  

**File:** `Array&String/Concatenation of Array.java`

---

#### 3. Contains Duplicate (LeetCode 217)
**Problem:**  
Checks if any value appears more than once in the array using a `HashSet` for O(n) time complexity.  

**File:** `Array&String/ContainsDuplicate.java`

---

#### 4. Remove Element (LeetCode 27)
**Problem:**  
Removes all occurrences of a given value in-place and returns the new length of the array.  
Uses a two-pointer approach for in-place modification without extra space.  

**File:** `Array&String/Removeelement.java`

---

### **Binary Search**
- **Find Peak Element (LeetCode 162)**  
  Finds an element greater than its neighbors using binary search on index space.  
  *File:* `Binary Search/FindPeakElement.java`

- **Search in Rotated Sorted Array (LeetCode 33)**  
  Modified binary search to handle rotated sorted arrays.  
  *File:* `Binary Search/SearchInRotatedSortedArray.java`

- **Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array (LeetCode 34)**  
  Uses two binary searches to find the first and last occurrence of a target.  
  *File:* `Binary Search/FirstAndLastPosition.java`

- **Search Insert Position (LeetCode 35)**  
  Finds the index of a target or the position to insert it to maintain sorted order.  
  *File:* `Binary Search/SearchInsertPosition.java`

---

### **Sliding Window**
- **Length of Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**  
  Uses a sliding window and hash set to find the maximum length substring with all unique characters.  
  *File:* `Sliding Window/lenghtoflongestsubstring.java`

---

## üõ† Tech Stack
