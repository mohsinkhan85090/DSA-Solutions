## üìÇ Folder Structure & Problem Index

### **Array & String**
- **Two Sum (LeetCode 1)**  
  Finds two numbers in an array that sum to a given target using a hash map for O(n) complexity.  
  *File:* `Array&String/Twosum.java`

- **Concatenation of Array**  
  Concatenates an array to itself and returns the new array.  
  *File:* `Array&String/Concatenation of Array.java`

---

### **Binary Search**
- **Find Peak Element (LeetCode 162)**  
  Finds an element greater than its neighbors using binary search on index space.  
  *File:* `Binary Search/FindPeakElement.java`

- **Search in Rotated Sorted Array (LeetCode 33)**  
  Modified binary search to handle rotated sorted arrays.  
  *File:* `Binary Search/SearchInRotatedSortedArray.java`

- **Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array (LeetCode 34)**  
  Uses two binary searches to find the first and last occurrence of a target.  
  *File:* `Binary Search/FirstAndLastPosition.java`

- **Search Insert Position (LeetCode 35)**  
  Finds the index of a target or the position to insert it to maintain sorted order.  
  *File:* `Binary Search/SearchInsertPosition.java`

---

### **Sliding Window**
- **Length of Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**  
  Uses a sliding window and hash set to find the maximum length substring with all unique characters.  
  *File:* `Sliding Window/lenghtoflongestsubstring.java`
