# 📈 DSA — My Data Structures & Algorithms Journey in Java  

Welcome to my personal **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** repository, where I solve and document popular coding problems from platforms like **LeetCode** using **Java** (sometimes Python).  
Each folder represents a DSA topic and contains **clean, optimized code** with clear logic and standard patterns.
