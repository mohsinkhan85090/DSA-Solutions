## 🔍 Binary Search Problems
### 1. Find Peak Element (LeetCode 162)

**Problem:**  
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.  
Find any one peak element and return its index.

**Example:**  
Input: `[1,2,3,1]` → Output: `2`  
Input: `[1,2,1,3,5,6,4]` → Output: `1` or `5`

**Approach:**  
Use a binary search on index space.  
- If `nums[mid] > nums[mid+1]`, search left.  
- Else, search right.

### 2. Search in Rotated Sorted Array (LeetCode 33)

**Problem:**  
Search for a target in a rotated sorted array without duplicates.

**Example:**  
Input: `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`, target = `0` → Output: `4`

**Approach:**  
Modified binary search:  
- Check which side is sorted.  
- Narrow down based on target position.

### 3. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array (LeetCode 34)

**Problem:**  
Find the starting and ending position of a given target value.  
If not found, return `[-1, -1]`.

**Example:**  
Input: `nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10]`, target = `8` → Output: `[3, 4]`

**Approach:**  
Two binary searches:  
- One for first occurrence.  
- One for last occurrence.

### 4. Search Insert Position (LeetCode 35)

**Problem:**  
Given a sorted array and a target, return the index if found, or the position it should be inserted to keep the order.

**Example:**  
Input: `nums = [1,3,5,6]`, target = `5` → Output: `2`  
Input: `nums = [1,3,5,6]`, target = `2` → Output: `1`  
Input: `nums = [1,3,5,6]`, target = `7` → Output: `4`

**Approach:**  
Binary search:  
- If `nums[mid] == target`, return `mid`.  
- If target is less, move `right = mid - 1`.  
- If target is greater, move `left = mid + 1`.  
- Final `left` is the insert position.

### 5. Search in Rotated Sorted Array (LeetCode 33)

**Problem:** Given a sorted array `nums` that has been rotated at an unknown pivot, return the index of a `target` value if it exists, or `-1` otherwise. The values in `nums` are distinct.

**Example:**
* **Input:** `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`, `target = 0`
* **Output:** `4`

**Approach:** This problem uses a modified binary search. The key is to identify which half of the array (left or right of `mid`) is sorted. Once the sorted half is identified, we check if the `target` falls within that sorted range. If it does, we search in that half; otherwise, we search in the other (unsorted) half. This allows us to reduce the search space by half in each step, maintaining `O(log n)` complexity.
