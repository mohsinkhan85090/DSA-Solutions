# üìà DSA‚Äì My Data Structures & Algorithms Journey in Java


This repository is a personal collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms** problems solved in **Java**.  
It is organized **folder-wise** according to topics, each containing clean and optimized solutions following common DSA patterns.

## Array&String 
```java
1. Two Sum (LeetCode 1)
Problem: Find two numbers in an array that sum to a given target.  
Approach: Uses a HashMap for O(n) time complexity.  
File: `Array&String/Twosum.java`  

Example:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]

2. Concatenation of Array (LeetCode 1929)
Problem: Concatenates an array to itself and returns the new array.
File: Array&String/Concatenation of Array.java

Example:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3,1,2,3]

3. Contains Duplicate (LeetCode 217)
Problem: Checks if any value appears more than once in the array.
Approach: Uses a HashSet for O(n) time complexity.
File: Array&String/ContainsDuplicate.java

Example:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true

4. Remove Element (LeetCode 27)
Problem: Remove all occurrences of a given value in-place and return the new length.
Approach: Two-pointer method for in-place modification without extra space.
File: Array&String/Removeelement.java

Example:
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]

5. Majority Element (LeetCode 169)
Problem: Finds the element that appears more than n/2 times.
File: Array&String/MajorityElement.java

Example:
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3

6. Missing Number (LeetCode 268)
Problem: Finds the missing number in an array containing n distinct numbers in [0, n].
File: Array&String/Missingnumber.java

Example:
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2

7. Find Duplicate (LeetCode 287)
Problem: Finds a duplicate number in an array containing n+1 integers in [1, n].
File: Array&String/findDuplicate.java

Example:
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2

8. Find Peak Element (LeetCode 162)
Problem: Finds a peak element (greater than its neighbors).
File: Array&String/findPeakElement.java

Example:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2

9. Merge Sorted Array (LeetCode 88)
Problem: Merges two sorted arrays in-place.
File: Array&String/mergesortedarray.py

Example:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
 nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: nums1 = [1,2,2,3,5,6]

10. Move Zeroes (LeetCode 283)
Problem: Moves all zeroes to the end while keeping the relative order of non-zero elements.
File: Array&String/movezeros.java

Example:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

11. Search in Rotated Sorted Array (LeetCode 33)
Problem: Searches for a target in a rotated sorted array.
File: Array&String/search.java

Example:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

12. Search Insert Position (LeetCode 35)
Problem: Finds the index where a target should be inserted in a sorted array.
File: Array&String/searchinsertposition.java

Example:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2

13.Rotate Array (LeetCode 189)
Problem: Rotate an array to the right by k steps.
Approach: Use modulo indexing: B[i] = A[(i + k) % n]. This creates the rotated array efficiently.
File: Array&String/RotateArray.java

Example:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]


14. Maximum 69 Number (LeetCode 1323)
Problem: You are given a positive integer that only contains digits 6 and 9. You may change at most one digit 6 ‚Üí 9 to get the maximum possible number. Return the maximum number you can get.
Approach: Convert the number to a string (or digit array). Replace the first 6 with 9 and return the new number. This guarantees the maximum number because the leftmost digit has the highest place value.
File: Array&String/Maximum69Number.java

Example:
Input: 9669
Output: 9969
```
